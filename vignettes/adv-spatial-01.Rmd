# Overview


As the number of computational and statistical methods for the analysis single-cell and spatial transcriptomics continue to increase, you will find that they will be implemented in many languages. 
Often Python is the language of choice. 
Python is incredibly powerful and I increasingly interact with it on very frequent basis these days. 
To be able to leverage the single-cell and spatial software tools implemented in Python, today I am giving an overview of using Python from the perspective of an R user. 

Happy coding!

## Learning objectives

1. Install python on your local machine
2. Learn about the `reticulate` package to work interoperability between Python and R
3. Be able to translate between R and Python objects


## Overview

For this lesson, we will be using the [`reticulate` R package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate), which provides a set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:

- Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.

- Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).

## Install python

**Installing python**: If you would like recommendations on installing python, I like this resource: https://py-pkgs.org/02-setup#installing-python or using conda environments with mini-forge! 

**What's happening under the hood?**: `reticulate` embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. 

If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, `reticulate` can make your life better!

## Install `reticulate`

Let's try it out. Before we get started, you will need to install the packages, if not already: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.package("reticulate")
```

We will also load the `here` and `tidyverse` packages for our lesson:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
```

## python path

If python is not installed on your computer, you can use the `install_python()` function from `reticulate` to install it. 

- https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/install_python.html

If python is already installed, by default, `reticulate` uses the version of Python found on your `PATH`

```{r}
Sys.which("python3")
```

The `use_python()` function enables you to specify an alternate version, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_python("/usr/<new>/<path>/local/bin/python")
```

For example, I can define the path explicitly: 

```{r}
use_python("/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/bin/python", required = TRUE)
```

You can confirm that `reticulate` is using the correct version of python that you requested: 

```{r}
py_discover_config()
```


## Calling Python in R

There are a variety of ways to integrate Python code into your R projects:

1. **Python in R Markdown** — A new Python language engine for R Markdown that supports bi-directional communication between R and Python (R chunks can access Python objects and vice-versa).

2. **Importing Python modules** — The `import()` function enables you to import any Python module and call its functions directly from R.

3. **Sourcing Python scripts** — The `source_python()` function enables you to source a Python script the same way you would `source()` an R script (Python functions and objects defined within the script become directly available to the R session).

4. **Python REPL** — The `repl_python()` function creates an interactive Python console within R. Objects you create within Python are available to your R session (and vice-versa).

Below I will focus on introducing the first and last one. 
However, before we do that, let's introduce a bit about python basics.


## Python basics

Python is a **high-level**, **object-oriented programming** language useful to know for anyone analyzing data. The most important thing to know before learning Python, is that in Python, everything is an **object**. There is no compiling and no need to define the type of variables before using them. No need to allocate memory for variables. The code is very easy to learn and easy to read (syntax).

There is a large scientific community contributing to Python. Some of the most widely used libraries in Python are `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. 

### start python

There are two modes you can write Python code in: **interactive mode** or **script mode**.  If you open up a UNIX command window and have a command-line interface, you can simply type `python` (or `python3`) in the shell: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
python3
```

and the **interactive mode** will open up.  You can write code in the interactive mode and Python will *interpret* the code using the **python interpreter**.  

Another way to pass code to Python is to store code in a file ending in `.py`, and execute the file in the **script mode** using 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
python3 myscript.py
```

To check what version of Python you are using, type the following in the shell:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
python3 --version
```



## Python engine within R Markdown

The `reticulate` package includes a Python engine for R Markdown with the following features:

1. Run Python chunks in a single Python session embedded within your R session (shared variables/state between Python chunks)

2. Printing of Python output, including graphical output from `matplotlib`.

3. Access to objects created within Python chunks from R using the `py` object (e.g. `py$x` would access an `x` variable created within Python from R).

4. Access to objects created within R chunks from Python using the `r` object (e.g. `r.x` would access to `x` variable created within R from Python)

Built in conversion for many Python object types is provided, including [NumPy](https://numpy.org) arrays and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) data frames. 

## From Python to R

As an example, you can use Pandas to read and manipulate data then easily plot the Pandas data frame using `ggplot2`:

Let's first create a `flights.csv` dataset in R: 

```{r}
# checks to see if a folder called "data" exists; if not, it installs it
if(!file.exists(here("data"))){
  dir.create(here("data"))
}

# checks to see if a file called "flights.csv" exists; if not, it saves it to the data folder
if(!file.exists(here("data", "flights.csv"))){
  readr::write_csv(nycflights13::flights, 
                   file = here("data", "flights.csv"))
}

nycflights13::flights %>% 
  head()
```



Use Python to read in the file and do some data wrangling


```{python}
import pandas
flights_path = "/Users/stephaniehicks/Documents/github/teaching/cshlgsd2022/data/flights.csv"
flights = pandas.read_csv(flights_path)
flights = flights[flights['dest'] == "ORD"]
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights = flights.dropna()
flights
```

```{r}
head(py$flights)
py$flights_path 
```

```{r}
class(py$flights)
class(py$flights_path)
```

Next, we can use R to visualize the Pandas `DataFrame`. 
The data frame is loaded in as an R object now stored in the variable `py`.

```{r}
ggplot(py$flights, aes(x = carrier, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_jitter()
```


Note that the `reticulate` Python engine is enabled by default within R Markdown whenever `reticulate` is installed.


### From R to Python

Use R to read and manipulate data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
flights <- read_csv(here("data","flights.csv")) %>%
  filter(dest == "ORD") %>%
  select(carrier, dep_delay, arr_delay) %>%
  na.omit()

flights
```

### Use Python to print R dataframe

If you recall, we can access objects created within R chunks from Python using the `r` object (e.g. `r.x` would access to `x` variable created within R from Python). We can then ask for the first ten rows using the `head()` function in python.

```{python}
r.flights.head(10)
```



## import python modules

You can use the `import()` function to import any Python module and call it from R. For example, this code imports the Python `os` module in python and calls the `listdir()` function:

```{r}
os <- import("os")
os$listdir(".")
```

Functions and other data within Python modules and classes can be accessed via the `$` operator (analogous to the way you would interact with an R list, environment, or reference class).

Imported Python modules support code completion and inline help:

```{r reticulate-completion, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Using reticulate tab completion', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/images/reticulate_completion.png")
```

[**Source**: [Rstudio](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate)]

Similarly, we can import the pandas library: 

```{r}
pd <- import('pandas')
test <- pd$read_csv(here("data","flights.csv"))
head(test)
class(test)
```

or the scikit-learn python library: 

```{r}
skl_lr <- import("sklearn.linear_model")
skl_lr
```



## Calling python scripts

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source_python("secret_functions.py")
subject_1 <- read_subject("secret_data.csv")
```

## Calling the python repl

If you want to work with Python interactively you can call the `repl_python()` function, which provides a Python REPL embedded within your R session. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
repl_python()
```

Objects created within the Python REPL can be accessed from R using the `py` object exported from `reticulate`. For example:

```{r repl-python, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Using the repl_python() function', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/images/python_repl.png")
```

[**Source**: [Rstudio](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate)]

i.e. objects do have permenancy in R after exiting the python repl. 

So typing `x = 4` in the repl will put `py$x` as 4 in R after you exit the repl.

Enter exit within the Python REPL to return to the R prompt.





# Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
